        Welcome to Stack-N-Serve! This is a game where you can play as a chef and serve customers by making burgers. You can
        earn money by making burgers and serving them to customers. You can also lose money by skipping customers or making
        the wrong burger. 
    </p>
    <div class="Player_Guide_Rules">
        <p>Following are the rules of the game:
            <li>Customers will come to your restaurant and order a burger. They will also tell you how much they are willing to pay
                for the burger.</li>
            <li>You can make the burger by stacking the ingredients in the correct order, i.e. with a bun at the top and the bottom
                of the stack, and the correct ingredients in the middle. Non-bun ingredients can be in any order.</li>
            <li>If you skip an order, you will lose Rs.10. </li>
            <li>If you make the wrong burger, you will lose the cost of ingredients. </li>
            <li>If you make the right burger and serve it to the customer, you will earn money. However, there's a catch! The ingredients cost money, so you have to make sure that you are making a profit. Sometimes it might be a better option to skip an order. Choose wisely!</li>
            <li>Your initial balance in the game is Rs. 100.</li>
            <li>The time allotted to make the burgers is 120 seconds.</li>
        </p>

    <p class="Player_Guide_Intent">
        The intent of the game is to test your memory and speed. 
        <br>You need to remember where to find the ingredients asked for, and their prices.
        <br>You also need to be quick in making the burgers and serving them to the customers.
        <br>You need to calculate if the current order is profitable or not.
        <br>There is no option to remove any wrong ingredients you may have stacked. So, be careful while stacking the ingredients.
